        <div class="graph-item">
            <img src="img/bubble_and_pie_chart.png"/>
            <p class="description"> The bubble pie chart displays items and uses points and areas as marks, and position, color and size (area) as channels.
                The pie chart itself uses colors and size, and the pie charts are placed in certain positions on the coordinate grid.
                The marks are being used as items/nodes because they each represent their own entity, rather than a relationship between two items.  </p>
        </div>

         <div class="graph-item">
            <img src="img/bump_chart.png"/>
            <p class="description"> The bump chart displays links and uses points and lines as marks, and color, tilt and position as channels. The marks are
                being used as items/nodes because each point mark is being used to reprsent the attribute of the rank during a certain year. The line marks are being
                used as links because it shows the relationship between two of the nodes, with respect to how much the rank changed between two years.
            </p>
        </div>

         <div class="graph-item">
            <img src="img/mind_map.png"/>
            <p class="description"> The mind map displays a network of items/nodes and uses points and lines as marks, and color as a channel.
                The channel is used to represent the type of node, and the marks are being used as items/nodes with the lines being used as links to connect
                the nodes, representing a relationship/connection between the two nodes.
            </p>
        </div>

         <div class="graph-item">
            <img src="img/stacked_bar_chart.png"/>
            <p class="description"> The stacked bar chart displays items, and uses area as marks, and color, area and position as channels. 
                The area channels are used on each bar to show the quantity of each category in the bar, the color is used to distinguish 
                between each subcategory, and position of the bar shows which larger category the bar belongs to. The marks here are being used
                as items/nodes.
